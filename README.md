# Interpreters

I am now following CRAFTING INTERPRETERS book, but in Rust. Currently, I am doing **A Bytecode Virtual Machine**.

Objective
- Learn a compiler concept
- Learn how to actually implement compiler, umm I mean interpreter here.
- Learn Rust the hard way!

The way I learn from this book is that for each chapter
- I use LLM to write a code structure ask it to leave each function implementation to be my work.
- I implement a functionality for these functions by myself.

How to run:
- `cargo run`

Progress
- [x] Chunks of Bytecode
- [ ] A Virtual Machine
- [ ]...

Note to myself: I use Git on Ubuntu.

If you want to navigate to the result of each chapter, you can use
```
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

If you want to navigate to the most recent commit, use
```
git checkout master
```

I have supplement blogs here.
